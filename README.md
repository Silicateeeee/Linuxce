# LAUGH
LAUGH(Linux Adaptation for Universal Game Hacking)


### How to actually get it running

This was made in a distrobox so if you're using that here's how to set it up

### 1. Create your box  
If you haven't created your box yet:
```bash
distrobox create Name-Of-Choice
```

### 2. open your box  
If you haven't opened your box yet:
```bash
distrobox enter Name-Of-Choice
```

### 3. The stuff it needs  
You'll need a compiler and some graphics libraries for the UI:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y make gcc-c++ glfw-devel mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel
```

### 4. Build it  
Go into the folder where your files are and run:
```bash
make
```

If the build fails and complains about a missing file try:
```bash
dnf provides */name-of-file.h
```

### 5. Run it  
It needs root bc it messes with other program memory:
```bash
sudo ./LAUGH
```

## Some stuff to know

This is really only meant for game hacking so aslong as your doing nothing extreme it should be ok

You do need sudo to run it
